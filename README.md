## How to write a new parse
Parsers can be found in the `src/parser` folder. The parsers are distributed in categories. Each category has a folder and the parsers are located in this folder.

Parsers can be created as follows:
```Typescript
import { parser } from "../../utils/parser"

// creation of a parser
export default parser("parsername", ({log, content})=>{
  return "parserstring"
})
```
A parser must be in a category!
This is then entered in the corresponding folder in `index.ts`.

## How to write a new parse category
Parser categories are important to keep an overview of the individual parsers. In addition to the gaming-specific **X** dles, there are also some that come from the original, such as Wordle.

A category can be added as follows:
```Typescript
import type { Parser } from "../../types/parsers";
import { category } from "../../utils/parser";
import parsername from "./parsername";

// add all parsers to the category
const all_parsers: Parser[] = [parsername];

// creation of a category
export default category("newcategory", all_parsers);
```
The category should then be added to the list in the file `./src/parser/index.ts` at the end.
